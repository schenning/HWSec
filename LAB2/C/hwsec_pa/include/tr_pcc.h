 *  The \b tr_pcc library, a software library dedicated to the computation of
 *  Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC).
 *  \author Renaud Pacalet, renaud.pacalet@telecom-paristech.fr
 *  \date 2009-07-29
 *
 * Defines a data structure and a set of functions used to compute and manage
 * Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC) between a floating point (float),
 * one-dimension, vector random variable and a set of floating point scalar
 * random variables.  These coefficients are a statistical tool to evaluate the
 * correlation between random variables. In this library, the vectors are
 * considered as a collection of scalar floating point random variables and each
 * component of the vectors is considered as independant. In the following,
 * vectors are denoted Z[.] and the i-th component of vector Z[.] is denoted
 * Z[i]. The formula of a PCC between the vector random variable X[.] and the
 * scalar random variable Y is:<br>
 *   PCC(X[.], Y)[.] = {E(X[.]*Y) - E(X[.])*E(Y)[.]} / {s(X[.]) * s(Y)[.]}<br>
 * where E(Z) is the expectation (average value) of random variable Z and s(Z)
 * is its unbiased standard deviation. E(Z[.])[.] is the expectation vector of
 * the vector random variable Z[.]: each component of E(Z[.])[.] is the
 * expectation of the corresponding component of Z[.]: E(Z[.])[i] = E(Z[i]).
 * Similarly, s(Z[.])[.] is the unbiased standard deviation vector of the vector
 * random variable Z[.]: s(Z[.])[i] = s(Z[i]). The product between a vector and
 * a scalar is defined as: (X[.]*Y)[i] = X[i]*Y. The PCC between a vector random
 * variable X and a scalar random variable Y is a vector defined by:<br>
 *   PCC(X[.], Y)[i] = PCC(X[i], Y)<br>
 * The \b tr_pcc library can be used to compute a set of PCCs between one vector
 * random variable (denoted X[.]), common to all PCCs, and a set of scalar
 * random variables (denoted Y0, Y1, ..., Yn-1). To compute such a set of PCCs
 * one must first initialize a PCC context (tr_pcc_init()), indicating the
 * number ny of Y random variables. Then, realizations of the random variables
 * must be accumulated into the context: first a realization of the X[.]
 * variable (tr_pcc_insert_x()), followed by realizations of each of the ny Y
 * variables (tr_pcc_insert_y()). Once a sufficient number of realizations are
 * accumulated in the PCC context, a call to tr_pcc_consolidate() computes the
 * ny PCCs. Calls to tr_pcc_get_pcc() return the different vector PCCs. Note:
 * more realizations can be accumulated after a call to tr_pcc_consolidate(),
 * another call to tr_pcc_consolidate() will take them into account altogether
 * with the previous ones and compute the new PCC values. A call to
 * tr_pcc_free() deallocates the PCC context and makes it reusable for the
 * computation of a new set of PCCs. Example of use with 10-components vectors
 * and ny=4 Y scalar variables, in which get_next_x and get_next_y are two
 * functions returning realizations of the random variables:
 * \code
 * tr_pcc_context ctx;
 * float *x, y, *pcc;
 * int i, j, nexp;
 * ...
 * ctx = tr_pcc_init(10, 4); // 10-samples traces, 4 PCCs
 * for(i = 0; i < nexp; i++) { // For experiments
 *   x = get_next_x();
 *   tr_pcc_insert_x(ctx, x);
 *   for(j = 0; j < 4; j++) { // For PCCs
 *     y = get_next_y(j);
 *     tr_pcc_insert_y(ctx, j, y);
 *     }
 *   }
 * tr_pcc_consolidate(ctx);
 * for(j = 0; j < 4; j++) { // For PCCs
 *   pcc = tr_pcc_get_pcc(ctx, j);
     printf("PCC(X[.], Y%d)[.] =", j);
 *   for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) // For samples
 *     printf(" %lf", pcc[i]);
 *   printf("\n");
 *   }
 * tr_pcc_free(ctx);
 * ctx = tr_pcc_init(100, 12); // 100-samples traces, 12 PCCs
 * ...
 * tr_pcc_free(ctx);
 * \endcode
 * \attention 
 * It is an error to break the realization insertion scheme: if you initialized
 * your PCC context for ny Y variables, first insert a realization of X[.],
 * followed by one and only one realization of each of the ny Y variables. Then,
 * insert a new realization of X[.] and ny new realizations of the ny Y
 * variables, and so on.  Consolidate only after inserting the realization of
 * the last Y variable. Do not consolidate when in an intermediate state.
